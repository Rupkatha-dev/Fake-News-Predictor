# Fake-News-Predictor
Project Overview:
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model classifies news articles as either real or fake based on their content, helping combat the spread of misinformation.

Features:
Implements text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization.
Uses classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes.
Integrates datasets for training and testing the model.
Achieves a measurable accuracy for reliable predictions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Dataset
Source:Kaggle.
The dataset contains labeled news articles with the fields: title, text, and label (real or fake).
